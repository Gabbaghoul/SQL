/*Using the data  from  http://marvel.wikia.com/Main_Page
 and data from http://observationdeck.io9.com/something-i-found-marvel-character-popularity-poll-cb-1568108064 
 and power grid data from http://marvel.wikia.com/Power_Grid#Power
 Collected by: https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/Mentrasto/. 
I used the aggregate functions to find the average, max, and min-height/weight for both genders in the marvel universe. 
I also queried the data with filter and case functions to sort out a power ranking for physical strength.*/

/*average/max/min height and weight for both genders in Marvel*/

Select name, gender, height_m, weight_kg from marvels 
order by height_m;
Select gender, avg(height_m), max(height_m), min(height_m), avg(weight_kg), max(weight_kg), min(weight_kg) from marvels 
group by gender;
select name, height_m, weight_kg from marvels where height_m >1.99 and weight_kg >200;

/*rating strength for marvel characters*/

select name,strength from marvels
order by strength desc;
select strength,
case
when strength >= 5 then "strong"
when strength <= 2 then "weak"
else "average"
end as "physical_strength" from marvels
group by physical_strength;
